# Hi there, I'm Bunny 👋

🚀 **Aspiring Software Engineer | AI & ML Enthusiast | Open Source Contributor**

I’m currently an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. My journey in tech began out of pure curiosity—wondering how the digital world works behind the scenes—and has since evolved into a deep passion for building, exploring, and innovating with code.

I believe technology is not just about machines or algorithms, but about making life better, solving real-world problems, and connecting people in meaningful ways. I love experimenting with new technologies and frameworks, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges that push my boundaries and help me learn.
